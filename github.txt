In the early 16th century, northern India, then under mainly Muslim rulers,[124] fell again to the superior mobility and firepower of a new
 generation of Central Asian warriors.[125] The resulting Mughal Empire did not stamp out the local societies it came to rule. Instead, it 
 balanced and pacified them through new administrative practices[126][127] and diverse and inclusive ruling elites,[128] leading to more 
 systematic, centralised, and uniform rule.[129] Eschewing tribal bonds and Islamic identity, especially under Akbar, the Mughals united 
 their far-flung realms through loyalty, expressed through a Persianised culture, to an emperor who had near-divine status.[128] The Mughal
  state's economic policies, deriving most revenues from agriculture[130] and mandating that taxes be paid in the well-regulated silver 
  currency,[131] caused peasants and artisans to enter larger markets.[129] The relative peace maintained by the empire during much of
   the 17th century was a factor in India's economic expansion,[129] resulting in greater patronage of painting, literary forms, textiles,
    and architecture.[132] Newly coherent social groups in northern and western India, such as the Marathas, the Rajputs, and the Sikhs,
     gained military and governing ambitions during Mughal rule, which, through collaboration or adversity, gave them both recognition and
      military experience.[133] Expanding commerce during Mughal rule gave rise to new Indian commercial and political elites along the
       coasts of southern and eastern India.[133] As the empire disintegrated, many among these elites were able to seek and control their
        own affairs.[134]
Historians consider India's modern age to have begun sometime between 1848 and 1885. The appointment in 1848 of Lord Dalhousie as Governor General of the East India Company set the stage for changes essential to a modern state. These included the consolidation and demarcation of sovereignty, the surveillance of the population, and the education of citizens. Technological changes—among them, railways, canals, and the telegraph—were introduced not long after their introduction in Europe.[142][143][144][145] However, disaffection with the company also grew during this time and set off the Indian Rebellion of 1857. Fed by diverse resentments and perceptions, including invasive British-style social reforms, harsh land taxes, and summary treatment of some rich landowners and princes, the rebellion rocked many regions of northern and central India and shook the foundations of Company rule.[146][147] Although the rebellion was suppressed by 1858, it led to the dissolution of the East India Company and the direct administration of India by the British government. Proclaiming a unitary state and a gradual but limited British-style parliamentary system, the new rulers also protected princes and landed gentry as a feudal safeguard against future unrest.[148][149] In the decades following, public life gradually emerged all over India, leading eventually to the founding of the Indian National Congress in 1885.[150][151][152][153]
