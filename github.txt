deriving most revenues from agriculture[130] and mandating that taxes be paid in the well-regulated silver affairs in india
  currency,[131] caused peasants and artisans to enter larger markets.[129] The relative peace maintained by the empire during much of
   the 17th century was a factor in India's economic expansion,[129] resulting in greater patronage of painting, literary forms, textiles,
    and architecture.[132] Newly coherent social groups in northern and western India, such as the Marathas, the Rajputs, and the Sikhs,
     gained military and governing ambitions during Mughal rule, which, through collaboration or adversity, gave them both recognition and
      military experience.[133] Expanding commerce during Mughal rule gave rise to new Indian commercial and political elites along the
       coasts of southern and eastern India.[133] As the empire disintegrated, many among these elites were able to seek and control their
        own affairs.[134]
